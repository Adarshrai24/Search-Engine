This is a sample text file for testing the Search Engine project.

The purpose of this file is to provide text data so that the parser can 
read lines, the trie can store words, and the search module can 
retrieve occurrences.

Example lines:
Hello world, this is line one.
This project demonstrates how a trie can be used for word search.
The word hello appears multiple times in this file.
Searching for test should also return a valid line.
Good luck building the rest of the project!
